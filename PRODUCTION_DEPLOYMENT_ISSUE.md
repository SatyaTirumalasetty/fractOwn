# Production Deployment Issue - Logo Upload

## Problem
User is unable to upload logo in production environment, getting "Failed to get upload URL" error.

## Root Cause Analysis
- **Development Environment**: Logo upload endpoints working perfectly
- **Production Environment**: Endpoints return "Not Found" (404)
- **Issue**: Production deployment is missing the logo management system

## Current Status
1. **Logo Management System**: Fully implemented and tested in development ✅
2. **Production Build**: Created successfully (791.21 kB frontend bundle) ✅  
3. **Production Deployment**: NOT updated with latest build ❌

## Required Action
The user needs to deploy the latest build to production using Replit's deployment system:

### Deployment Steps:
1. Click the "Deploy" button in Replit interface
2. Select production environment
3. Deploy latest build (includes logo management endpoints)
4. Verify deployment includes all recent changes

### After Deployment:
- Logo upload endpoints will be available at production URL
- Admin can upload logos successfully from branding settings
- Logos will display dynamically in header and hero sections

## Technical Details
- **Missing Endpoints in Production**:
  - `/api/admin/logo/upload` (POST) - Returns 404 in production
  - `/api/admin/logo/save` (POST) - Returns 404 in production
- **Object Storage**: Already configured and working
- **Frontend Code**: Updated with proper upload flow
- **Authentication**: Working in both environments

## Resolution
Deploy latest production build - all logo functionality will work immediately after deployment.
