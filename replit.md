## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The client-side application is built using React 18 with TypeScript, following a component-based, single-page application (SPA) pattern. Styling is managed with Tailwind CSS and custom design tokens for consistent theming. Key libraries include shadcn/ui for UI components, Wouter for routing, TanStack Query for server state management, and React Hook Form with Zod for form handling and validation. Custom CSS variables enable consistent branding.

### Backend Architecture
The server-side uses Express.js with TypeScript, implementing a RESTful API pattern for managing properties and contacts. It features an abstracted storage layer, currently in-memory for development, designed for future database integration. Zod schemas are used for request validation, ensuring type safety. Vite is integrated for hot module replacement during development.

### Data Management
The system emphasizes end-to-end type safety. Shared TypeScript types and Zod schemas are used across both client and server to define data structures. Centralized validation logic is applied using Zod. TanStack Query manages data caching, synchronization, and optimistic updates on the client side.

### Development Architecture
The project utilizes Vite for fast development builds and hot module replacement, with npm for package management. TypeScript is configured with path mapping for clean imports. The codebase is organized as a monorepo, ensuring clear separation of concerns and shared schemas.

### Configuration Architecture
The application uses a centralized configuration system (`config/app.config.js`) supporting multi-environment setups (development, staging, production). It manages database flexibility (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite), file upload settings, security parameters (session management, CORS, rate limiting, authentication), business logic (investment limits, regions, currency), and feature flags. A separate `config/support.config.js` is reserved for authorized support team access, containing scripts for database migrations, maintenance, emergency recovery, and security auditing. All configurations support environment variable overrides for flexible deployment.
