### 3. Before Deployments
```bash
tsx scripts/backup-database.ts create "Pre-deployment backup"
```

### 4. Emergency Recovery
```bash

## Built-in Replit Database Backup

According to Replit documentation, you also have access to Replit's built-in database backup features:

### Point-in-Time Recovery
1. Navigate to the 'Replit Database' tool in your workspace
2. Select the 'Settings' tab
3. Use the 'History Retention' setting to configure automatic backups
4. Use the 'Restore' tool to recover to any point within your retention period

### Replit Native Restore Process
1. Go to Replit Database tool ‚Üí Settings tab
2. Enter target date and time in the 'Timestamp' field
3. Click 'Restore' and confirm the action

## Dual Backup Strategy

For maximum protection, you now have two backup options:

1. **Custom Backup Script** (this system):
   - Full control over backup timing and storage
   - Custom metadata and descriptions
   - Local file access for inspection
   - Programmatic backup creation

2. **Replit Native Backups**:
   - Automatic point-in-time recovery
   - Managed by Replit infrastructure
   - Easy GUI-based restore process
   - Built-in retention policies

## Security Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Backup File Security**:
- Backup files contain all your production data
- Store backups securely and limit access
- Consider encrypting sensitive backup files
- Regularly clean up old backup files

‚ö†Ô∏è **Restore Operations**:
- Always verify backup integrity before restore
- Create a current backup before restoring old data
- Test restore procedures in development first
- Coordinate with your team before production restores

## Support

Your backup system is now ready to protect your production database. The system has been tested and verified to work correctly with your current database schema.
