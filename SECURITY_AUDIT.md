# Security Audit and Hardening Report

## Executive Summary
This document outlines the security vulnerabilities identified and the hardening measures implemented for the fractOWN platform, with special focus on TOTP/2FA authentication security.

## Security Vulnerabilities Identified and Fixed

### 1. TOTP Secret Storage and Management
**Issue**: TOTP secrets stored without encryption
**Fix**: Implement AES-256-GCM encryption for TOTP secrets at rest

### 2. Session Management
**Issue**: Session tokens without proper entropy and expiration handling
**Fix**: Enhanced session security with cryptographically secure tokens

### 3. Rate Limiting
**Issue**: Insufficient protection against brute force attacks
**Fix**: Aggressive rate limiting for authentication endpoints

### 4. Input Validation
**Issue**: Insufficient validation on TOTP tokens and sensitive inputs
**Fix**: Comprehensive input sanitization and validation

### 5. Backup Codes Security
**Issue**: Backup codes stored in plain text
**Fix**: Hash backup codes using bcrypt with salt

### 6. TOTP Window Configuration
**Issue**: Wide time window allowing replay attacks
**Fix**: Reduced window and implemented token replay prevention

### 7. Logging Security
**Issue**: Sensitive data logged in plain text
**Fix**: Redacted sensitive information in logs

## Performance Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Database Connection Pooling
- Optimized connection pool settings
- Added connection monitoring

### 2. Caching Layer
- Implemented Redis-compatible caching for sessions
- Added query result caching

### 3. Rate Limiting Optimization
- Memory-efficient rate limiting with sliding windows
- Reduced database hits for rate limit checks

### 4. TOTP Generation Optimization
- Cached QR code generation
- Optimized secret generation process

## Compliance
- **OWASP Top 10**: All major vulnerabilities addressed
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Implemented security controls
- **GDPR**: Enhanced data protection measures
- **Industry Standards**: Following TOTP RFC 6238 specifications

## Next Steps
- Regular security audits (quarterly)
- Penetration testing
- Security awareness training
- Continuous monitoring implementation
