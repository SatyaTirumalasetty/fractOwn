Welcome to fractOWN! This is a complete web application that allows people to invest in real estate properties with small amounts of money. Anyone can set up and run this application on their own server by following these simple instructions.

## üöÄ What is fractOWN?

fractOWN democratizes real estate investment by allowing users to:
- Invest in premium properties starting from just ‚Çπ10 Lakhs
- View detailed property information with multiple images
- Track investment progress and returns
- Manage properties through an admin dashboard

## üìã What You Need Before Starting

### Step 1: System Requirements
Your server/computer needs:
- **Operating System**: Windows 10/11, macOS, or Linux
- **Memory**: At least 4GB RAM
- **Storage**: At least 10GB free space
- **Internet**: Stable internet connection

### Step 2: Install Required Software

#### A. Install Node.js (JavaScript Runtime)
1. Go to https://nodejs.org
2. Download the "LTS" version (recommended for most users)
3. Run the installer and follow the instructions
4. Open a terminal/command prompt and type: `node --version`
5. You should see a version number like "v20.x.x"

#### B. Install a Database (Choose One)

**Option 1: PostgreSQL (Recommended)**
1. Go to https://www.postgresql.org/download/
2. Download PostgreSQL for your operating system
3. Install with these settings:
   - Username: `postgres`
   - Password: `your_secure_password` (remember this!)
   - Port: `5432`
4. Make note of your username, password, and port

**Option 2: MySQL**
1. Go to https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/
2. Download MySQL Community Server
3. Install with default settings
4. Remember your root password

**Option 3: SQLite (Easiest)**
- No installation needed! SQLite creates a file on your computer
- Good for testing but not recommended for production

#### C. Install Git (Version Control)
1. Go to https://git-scm.com/downloads
2. Download Git for your operating system
3. Install with default settings

## üèóÔ∏è Setting Up fractOWN

### Step 1: Download the Application

**Option A: Download from GitHub**
1. Go to your fractOWN project page
2. Click the green "Code" button
3. Click "Download ZIP"
4. Extract the ZIP file to a folder like `C:\fractOWN` or `/home/user/fractOWN`

**Option B: Using Git (if you have it)**
```bash
git clone [your-repository-url]
cd fractOWN
```

### Step 2: Open Terminal/Command Prompt
- **Windows**: Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, press Enter
- **macOS**: Press `Cmd + Space`, type `terminal`, press Enter
- **Linux**: Press `Ctrl + Alt + T`

Navigate to your fractOWN folder:
```bash
cd path/to/fractOWN
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
Type this command and wait for it to finish:
```bash
npm install
```

This downloads all the necessary files for the application.

### Step 4: Configure the Application

#### Option A: Automatic Setup (Recommended)
Run the setup script:
```bash
npm run setup
```

This will ask you questions like:
- What database do you want to use?
- What's your database password?
- What port should the server run on?

Answer each question, and the script will create all necessary files.

#### Option B: Manual Setup
Create a file called `.env` in your fractOWN folder with this content:

**For PostgreSQL:**
```env
# Server Settings
PORT=5000
HOST=0.0.0.0
NODE_ENV=production

# Database Settings
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:your_password@localhost:5432/fractown
PGHOST=localhost
PGPORT=5432
PGDATABASE=fractown
PGUSER=postgres
PGPASSWORD=your_password

# Security
SESSION_SECRET=your_random_secret_key_here

# File Uploads
MAX_FILE_SIZE=10485760
UPLOAD_PATH=./uploads
```

**For MySQL:**
```env
# Server Settings
PORT=5000
HOST=0.0.0.0
NODE_ENV=production

# Database Settings
MYSQL_HOST=localhost
MYSQL_PORT=3306
MYSQL_DATABASE=fractown
MYSQL_USER=root
MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_password

# Security
SESSION_SECRET=your_random_secret_key_here

# File Uploads
MAX_FILE_SIZE=10485760
UPLOAD_PATH=./uploads
```

**For SQLite:**
```env
# Server Settings
PORT=5000
HOST=0.0.0.0
NODE_ENV=production

# Database Settings
SQLITE_PATH=./data/fractown.db

# Security
SESSION_SECRET=your_random_secret_key_here

# File Uploads
MAX_FILE_SIZE=10485760
UPLOAD_PATH=./uploads
```

Replace `your_password` with your actual database password.

### Step 5: Set Up the Database
Run these commands one by one:

```bash
# Create the database structure
npm run db:push

# Add sample data (optional but recommended)
npm run seed
```

If successful, you'll see:
- "Database schema created successfully"
- "Database seeded with sample data"
- Default admin credentials: admin / admin123

## üöÄ Starting the Application

### For Development/Testing
```bash
npm run dev
```

### For Production
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

You should see:
```
[express] serving on port 5000
```

1. Open your web browser
2. Go to: `http://localhost:5000`

3. **Install on Server**

   - Change `HOST=0.0.0.0` in your `.env` file
   - Use a production database (not SQLite)

4. **Set Up Reverse Proxy**
   - Install Nginx or Apache

   pm2 save
   pm2 startup
   ```

## ‚ùó Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Port already in use"**
- Change `PORT=5000` to `PORT=3000` or another number in `.env`
- Or stop other applications using that port

**"Database connection failed"**
- Check if your database is running
- Verify username/password in `.env` file
- Make sure database name exists

**"Permission denied"**
- On Linux/macOS, you might need `sudo` for some commands
- Check file permissions: `chmod 755 fractOWN`

**"Module not found"**
- Delete `node_modules` folder
- Run `npm install` again

**Images not uploading**
- Check if `uploads` folder exists and is writable
- Verify file size limits in admin settings
- Check file format is supported

### Getting Help

1. **Check the Error Messages**
   - Read the full error message
   - Look for clues about what went wrong

2. **Check Log Files**
   - Look in the terminal where you started the application
   - Error messages will show there

3. **Common Solutions**
   - Restart the application: Stop with `Ctrl+C`, then `npm run dev`
   - Restart your database service
   - Check your `.env` file for typos
